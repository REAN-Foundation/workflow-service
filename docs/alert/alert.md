# Project ALERT(NGO) - Emergency Response System

__Project Overview__
The project is focused on emergency response, initiated by Rajesh and Divya from Alert based in Chennai.
They have the support of President Abdul Kalam for this project.
The goal is to respond to emergencies by notifying trained volunteers, called Community First Responders (CFRs), who can provide emergency response services.

__Initial Use Case__
The initial use case is to notify CFRs (who are trained in CPR and other emergency response services to show up at the scene of an accident).
In the future, the plan is to also send specific messages to the person requesting help and provide step-by-step processes for the CFRs.

__Workflow and Features__
When someone initiates a request, it will be broadcasted to CFRs within a 1.5-kilometer radius on a round-robin basis.
The first CFR to acknowledge the request becomes the primary responder.
Both the initiator and the CFR will have the ability to trigger an ambulance call if needed.
An emergency response action bot will assist both the initiator and CFR with necessary actions until help arrives.
(The team plans to focus on connecting the initiator and CFR, and automating triggers for ambulance calls based on criteria, as the initial priorities.)

__Team Roles__
Santosh will handle MoU signings and joint proposals.
Vishal will set up the project infrastructure like weekly calls, document sharing, and communication channels.
Nisha will be responsible for the backend logic and workflows.
Vinay has previously worked on the Blood Warriors project and will contribute to the team.
Additional team members like LLM and ML engineers will join as needed for AI and other capabilities.

__Next Steps__
The team will focus on implementing the basic functionality first, such as the flow where the system asks if the person is facing a medical emergency and triggers an ambulance call if needed.
They will also work on enabling independent communication between the initiator and CFR, and exploring options for real-time location tracking of CFRs.
The team will discuss and decide on the separation of the emergency response channel and the training/learning channel.
They will also determine the logic for grouping and selecting the appropriate CFRs to notify based on the location of the emergency.
